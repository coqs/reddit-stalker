# how to use (windows only btw)
1) obviously download zip from the github, and then extract it anywhere but remember where it is because your gonna use it obv!!! <br />
2) download NodeJS https://nodejs.org/en/download <br />
3) open the config.json file with notepad <br />
4) get your gemini-api-key from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey and copy it to your clipboard!!! <br />
5) now paste that gemini key in the ```YOUR_GEMINI_KEY``` part (dont remove the quotations!) for e.g: <br />
```"gemini_api_key": "AIzaS....."``` <br />
6) now edit the ```"username": "spicy_tables",``` with the username obviously same thing like gemini key for e.g: <br />
```"username": "cheesloverguy34221",``` <br />
7) now run the main.bat!! wait until it says "DONE!!!!" in the command window, then your free to close the main.bat window command! <br />
8) now go check the output folder and find the txt file with the stalk username and open it with notepad, and enjoy!

you dont have to do from steps 1 to 8 every time you stalk someone else<br />
just do the steps from 6-8, thats it!
